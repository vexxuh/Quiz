Shayne's Notes / Ideas





Gabe's Notes / Ideas
	- App Stuff
		- User / Host look, feel, accesability
		- The "Must Haves" for the users and host
		- Local host idea (Shayne we gotta talk about this one, I figured out a plan sorta)
		- After these things are decided on, we can just take it from here I think?
	- Monetary Things (I'll let you talk here Shayne, you seem to have a better understanding than me)
		- Pricing before Jerry
			- No payment from Jerry, just a website host and a whole hell of a lot of advertisement
		- Pricing after Jerry
			- The point at which we're self sustaining
			- Lower price for Jerry for all the help to get us started
			- Subscription (Monthly?)
		- We'll have to write this all down and get it signed off on in person at some point over break, we can try and set up a day to meet jerry early to a teen night at JY honestly since it's the best time for all of us to meet since Jerry lives so far away.
